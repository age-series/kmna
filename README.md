# kmna

kMNA is a library created from the Electrical Age Modified Nodal Analysis engine. I completely re-implemented it in Kotlin, and intend to use it as a dependency for all new Electrical Age builds.

This engine also includes a thermal system to handle thermal properties of the items.

## Usage

This project uses the most recent stable Gradle and Kotlin, so I suggest you use IDEA if you plan to develop for it.

Currently, compiling and running the test is simply:

```
./gradlew
```

Later, I will add a more comprehensive testing suite.

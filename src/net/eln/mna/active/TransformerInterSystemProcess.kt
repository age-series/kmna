        Experimentally, lowering the resistance between two isolated transformers causes a bit of a capacitance bug.
        I can't fix it for some reason by increasing the resistnace here, but this function does some things that are
        not very good, and it should be combined with the function above the static Th class above.

        Before you try to comb the source code for anything usable about how this class works, I already checked all of
        the source code, and it was never re-written or commented. It just "came to be".

        It should be noted that lowering the resistance here does have some interesting effects, but none of the ones I
        was looking for. Namely, it caused a few things to asplode that were fine otherwise.
